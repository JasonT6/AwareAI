# AwareAI
Millions of people worldwide currently suffer from vision impairment, with an estimated 253 mil
lion individuals affected according to the World Health Organization. Our project’s primary objec
tive is the creation of a system enabling visually impaired individuals to utilize their smartphone
camera for enhanced environmental awareness. This is achieved by reporting through voice nearby
obstacles and their positions relative to the user. For instance, the system may say, ”A chair is ap
proximately 2 meters ahead on your left.” By presenting this information audibly, users can heighten
their awareness, thus mitigating the risk of collisions, stumbles, and falls.
